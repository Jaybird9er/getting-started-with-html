<div><b>The Web:</b> A collection of docs made (mostly) with HTML. <br>
HTML docs are connected by hyperlinks. Users connect <br> 
to pages, via their computers, by sending out calls <br> 
(requests) in HTTP to servers, which then return those<br> 
requests as HTML docs.
</div>
<br>
<div><div><b>HTML:</b> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Langauge,<br>
or put simply, it is a formating language. HTML can <br>
markup text, reference
media, and link to other pages, like <br><em>www.google.com</em>.
<div><br>Each element in a webpage, consists of<br>
opening and closing tags that bookend the content. <b>Bold</b><br>
and <em>italics</em> are examples of formating tags. Some tags<br>
have attirbutes that allow for linking to <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">other pages</a>,<br>
or adding images: <img src="https://wscont.apps.microsoft.com/winstore/1x/0183ecae-4856-4af1-b989-e3cd91b5b42d/Icon.327992.png" alt="Udacity Image">

Other elements include Whitespace, such as Inline or Block 
<br>spacing, that dictate layout. Block spacing forms text into 
<br>blocks, leaving defined space around each element. 
<br>Inline spacing follows the HTML predefined spacing constructs.
